Fix 500 errors in tasks API and improve task creation UX

Backend Changes:
- Fixed UUID serialization in all task endpoints (list, create, get, update, complete, predict)
- TaskResponse now explicitly converts UUID id fields to strings
- This fixes 500 Internal Server Error when fetching tasks

Frontend Changes:
- Added loading state to task creation modal
- Disabled form buttons during submission to prevent duplicate task creation
- Added visual feedback (spinner and 'Creating...' text) during task creation
- Improved error handling with user-friendly messages
- Fixed duplicate submission prevention

LLM Client Improvements:
- Reduced log verbosity for ConnectError (changed from error to debug level)
- Only logs on first and last retry attempt to reduce noise
- Added informative message that LLM errors are normal if LLM is not configured
